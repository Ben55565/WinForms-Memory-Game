# WinForms-Memory-Game

The classic Memory Card game developed in .NET Framework using C#.
In this project me and my partner Ben Daniels worked with delegates in order for the user to interact with the WinForms platform.
The game starts with a settings window and has two modes: Vs Player or Vs Computer.
