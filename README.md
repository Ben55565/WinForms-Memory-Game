# WinForms-Memory-Game ðŸŽ´

The classic Memory Card game developed in .NET Framework using C#.  
In this project me and my partner Yarin Bar worked with delegates in order for the user to interact with the WinForms library.  
The game starts with a settings window and has two modes: Vs Player or Vs Computer.
